# MyProject
this weeks code-challenge was to create aproject which had a many to many relationship beetween 2 tables called Product and Users with their joining point being the reviews table. The way this relationship works is that the user owns many products and will have made many reviews for varying products therefore products will have many users and users will have many products.

# How it works
My project runs through the terminal, to get it to start you start by clonign the work into your local environment this is done by forking the repo the typing 
        git clone [link]
where the link is acquired by copying the ssh key after clicking on code

next would be to open the repo in your text editor then run the bundle install command within the terminal. To be able to test out the work you should run 
        bundle exec rake console
from the terminal. This allows you to test out the code and its features.
